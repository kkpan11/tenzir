# The Tenzir Integration Testing Framework

We run our integration tests on top of [`bats`](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io).

There is one custom library `bats-tenzir` that provides
common node setup and a `check` function that compares
the test output against a known reference file.

# Running integration tests

To run all tests, execute the `integration` target from CMake.

To run all tests in this directory, use `bats tests/`.

To run all tests in a specific test file, use e.g. `bats tests/version.test`

Note that bats can be invoked from any directory, since all paths are computed
relative to the test file.

To run the set of tests that failed during the last run of bats,
the `--filter-status failed` option can be used. This can also
be useful in combination with the `UPDATE` option below when updating
tests after implementing a breaking change.

To run one specific test, add the `bats:focus` tag to that test and
run the test file.

# Updating and creating references

To update or create reference files, run the `update-integration` target from
CMake, or set the `UPDATE=1` environment variable and run `bats`.

To update the references for one specific test, add the `bats:focus`
tag to that test and run bats with `UPDATE=1`. Only that test will
be executed and updated.

# Temporary files

There are variables `$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR` and `$BATS_FILE_TMPDIR`
automatically defined that point to a temporary directory that
is unique for this test or unique for the current test file
respectively.
