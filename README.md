## What is Tenzir?

Tenzir is the data pipeline engine for security teams.

If you need to collect, parse, shape, normalize, aggregate, store, query, and
route security telemetry data at scale, you'll love how our pipelines manage
your dataflows. Tenzir makes it easy to quickly onboard and store data from
numerous sources, reduce data volumes to optimize cloud and data costs, and
execute detections and run analytics in-stream.
