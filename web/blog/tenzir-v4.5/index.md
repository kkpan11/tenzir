Here comes [Tenzir v4.5](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.5.0)!
This release ships a potpourri of smaller improvements that result in faster
historical query execution and better deployability.

## More Robust Numeric Query Expressions

Ever scratched your head what numeric literal to use in a query so that you hit
the right fields in events? No more! You can now write `x < 42`, `x < +42`, or
`x < 42.0` in an expression to filter events where the field `x` is less than
42, regardless of whether `x` is of type `uint64`, `int64`, or `double`.
Previously, you had to know the exact number type for the expression to bind
properly to the event schema.

This incremental improvement is part of a larger thrust to improve the language.
We have plans to convert additional literals during expression bindings to
provide deeper reach into the data, without users really having to deal with
schemas.

## Sparse Indexes for Number Types

Tenzir's storage engine builds sparse indexes per partition. These sketch
data structures, like Bloom filters and min-max synopses, accelerate historical
queries by ensuring that only relevant partitions get loaded into memory.

We've now added additional sketches for types `bool`, `time`, `duration`,
`int64`, `uint64`, and `double` to accelerate a broader range of queries. For
example, this query now runs faster:

```
export
| where :time > 1 hour ago && dest_port == 80
```

## The Rest API as an Operator

We exposed [the Rest API](/api) as a new operator called `api`. The benefit
primarily materializes for developers, who can now rapidly prototype
integrations by using the app or `tenzir` command line tool, without having to
spin up the integrated web server and do gymnastics with `curl` and `jq`.

For example, to list all pipelines that were created through the API:

```
api /pipeline/list
```

This creates a new pipeline and starts it immediately:

```
api /pipeline/create '{"name": "Suricata Import", "definition": "from file /tmp/eve.sock read suricata", "autostart": {"created": true}}'
```

## Fine-Grained Operator, Format, and Connector Block Lists

We made it easier to disallow potentially unsafe operators, formats, and
connectors. The new `tenzir.disable-plugins` option is a list of names of
plugins to explicitly forbid from being used. For example, adding `export` will
prohibit use of the `export` operator builtin, thereby disabling the ability to
run historical queries. This method allows for a more fine-grained control than
the coarse `tenzir.allow-unsafe-pipelines` option.

Why does it matter? Well, when running pipelines in a node, some operators allow
you to fully interact with the system through a pipeline. The `shell` operator
is the best example, which allows for arbitrary command execution. This can be
both a huge relief and serve as escape hatch to integrate third-party tools, but
it is equally a security risk.

## This & That

- When you deploy a demo node at [app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com), it
  now starts up faster, and the pre-loaded pipelines come with labels and have been
  ported to use the new `api` operator instead of relying on `curl` for setup.

- It is now possible to reference nested records in many operators that wrangle
  data, such as `select`, `extend`, `put`, and `replace`.

- The `summarize` operator now yields a result even if it receives no input
  (assuming there is no grouping with `by`). For example, `summarize
  num=count(foo)` returns `{"num": 0}` instead of returning nothing.

- The `import` operator now flushes events to disk automatically before
  returning, ensuring that they are available immediately for subsequent uses of
  the `export` operator.
