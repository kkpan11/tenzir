activity, and the Tenzir Node has improved support for subnet keys in lookup
tables, and installs natively for RedHat Linux and its derivatives.

## RedHat Linux Support

Installing a Tenzir Node is now easier than ever on RedHat Linux and its
derivatives. As of this release, it is now possible to install Tenzir as an RPM
package. Just run the installer script to get started:

```bash
curl https://get.tenzir.app | sh
```

## Subnet Keys in Lookup Tables

The `lookup-table` context now handles subnet keys correctly. Lookups with an IP
address or subnet value now match if the key is within any of the subnets used
as keys. If multiple subnets match, then the best match is returned.

:::info Want to learn more?
We wrote a new user guide about using subnet keys in lookup tables: [Enrich with
Network Inventory](/next/usage/enrich-with-network-inventory).

## Sort by Multiple Fields

The `sort` operator now supports sorting by multiple fields, specified in order
of precedence. The following two examples have the exact same behavior, making
sorting by multiple fields much easier:

```text {0} title="Before: sorting was limited to one field at a time"
sort baz
| sort --stable bar
| sort --stable foo
```

```text {0} title="After: sorting now supports multiple fields"
sort foo, bar, baz
```

## Edit Pipelines

The `/pipeline/update` API endpoint now supports updating the definition of a
pipeline. This functionality will soon be available in the app for nodes that
support it. Gone are the times where editing a pipeline required copying its
definition, redeploying it, deleting the old and starting the new version.
