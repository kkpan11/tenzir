Tenzir Node v4.28 makes it easier than before to parse deeply nested data
structures.

## Parsing Nested Data Structures

With this release, we've added a bunch of new functions for parsing nested data
from a string:

- `parse_kv` parses key-value pairs.
- `parse_grok` parses Grok patterns.
- `parse_csv`, `parse_ssv`, and `parse_tsv` parse comma-, space-, and
  tab-separated values, respectively.
- `parse_leef` and `parse_cef` parse LEEF and CEF data, respectively.
- `parse_syslog` parses Syslog data.
- `parse_json` parses JSON values.
- `parse_yaml` parses YAML values.

:::tip Read the Guide
To learn more about parsing nested data structures, check out our new [guide on
parsing nested data](/next/usage/parse-nested-data).
:::

The new `parse_*` functions behave similar to the `read_*` operators, except
that they work on one string field at a time instead of a stream of bytes in the
pipeline.

## VSCode TQL Package
