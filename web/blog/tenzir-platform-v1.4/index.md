## Platform Alerts

The platform now supports monitoring individual nodes and triggering an
alert when the node stays disconnected for more than a configurable
threshold

This is useful for production nodes that are supposed to be online 24/7.
With alerts, it becomes easier

See [Platform CLI](/platform-cli) docs page for an overview and a usage
example.

## Other Improvements

As usual there's also a slew of additional improvements and bug fixes
provided in this release:

 * The tenant switcher is now significantly faster
 * Added a new diagnostics drawer in dashboard page
 * Fixed image downloads for charts
