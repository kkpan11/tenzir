## Platform Alerts

The platform now supports monitoring individual nodes and triggering an
alert when the node stays disconnected for more than a configurable
threshold.

This is useful for nodes that are supposed to be online 24/7.
With alerts, it becomes easier to notice unexpected downtime and stay
aware of the health of your cluster.

See the [Platform CLI](/platform-cli) docs page for an overview and a usage
example.

## Other Improvements

As usual there's also a slew of additional improvements and bug fixes
provided in this release:

 - The workspace switcher is now significantly faster
 - A new diagnostics drawer on the dashboard page makes warnings and errors more accessible
 - The image download of charts now works as expected
