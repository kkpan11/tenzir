We're overjoyed to [announce][pr] our highly-anticipated security data pipeline
platform at the renowned BlackHat conference in Las Vegas. The launch marks a
milestone in our journey to bring simplicity to data engineering for
cybersecurity operations, and to bring a cost-efficient way to tackle the
increasingly complex data engineering challenges that security teams confront
daily.

## Security Data Operations for the Automation Age

The volume of data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and stored by security
teams has skyrocketed. Traditional security operations tools are increasingly
overwhelmed, leading to an urgent need for more efficient and effective
solutions. Tenzir addresses this challenge head-on, simplifying data management
so that security teams can focus more on identifying and mitigating threats.

In the words of our CEO and founder, [Matthias
Vallentin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-vallentin/), "To survive in
today's unforgiving threat landscape you need fast, near real-time *and*
extensive historical data. Tenzir pipelines help security teams speed up and
simplify managing the data they need, so that they can spend more time doing
what is most crucial—hunting threats."

## Why Data Pipelines for Security?

Cybersecurity has become an increasingly data-driven field. From network traffic
to cloud telemetry, the amount of information that security teams need to
analyze is staggering. A single security incident can generate billions of data
points that need to be reviewed, analyzed, and actioned. Traditional methods of
collecting, aggregating, and analyzing this data are not just insufficient, they
are obsolete, leading to security gaps and cost inefficiencies.

Navigating the modern security data stack is no small feat. Today's security
teams are faced not just with the management of a horde of advanced security
solutions including SIEM, SOAR, UEBA, and threat intelligence platforms, but
also the challenge of integrating these systems with diverse data technologies,
such as databases, data lakes, and data warehouses. Compounding this complexity
is a growing reliance on cloud microservices and increasingly AI services. This
has made security operations less of a routine process and more a strategic
exercise in continuously mastering emergent complexities and optimizing
performance.

This is where Tenzir's security data pipelines come in. Our unique platform
instigates a shift from centralized security information and event management to
a more adaptive and decentralized operating model more aligned with DevOps and
data engineering principles: security data operations
([SecDataOps](https://tenzir.com/secdataops?utm_source=Blog)). It transcends
mere collection of events and logs, instead building resilient and robust data
flows that optimize data for further use, whether for detection and correlation,
threat hunting, or machine learning. Data pipelines are already common in data
engineering and DevOps. They are designed to provide a seamless, efficient, and
flexible way to manage and move data. But there are a number of reasons why data
pipelines are also the ideal solution for today's cybersecurity challenges.

- Firstly, security data pipelines optimize and formalize data management. They
  allow for the standardized collection, shaping, enrichment, and routing of
  data between any security and data technology. They also provide a measurable,
  repeatable and more cost-effective approach to solve the growing data
  engineering challenges typically faced by security teams.  As they are
  designed specifically for security use-cases, they also allow security teams
  to meet their own data needs.
- Secondly, and in today's economic climate more crucially, security data
  pipelines reduce consumption-based costs. By moving only the right data to the
  right place at the right time in the most efficient way, and by pushing
  detection and enrichment workloads to the network edge, businesses can
  drastically reduce their SIEM, cloud, and other data costs. Security
  operations become more efficient and cost-effective, ultimately allowing more
  data to be collected, and scarce money to be reallocated.
- Thirdly, security data pipelines help avoid vendor lock-in. Tenzir is built on
  open data and security standards, making data exchange between different
  technologies trivial. Pipelines also connect diverse tools and solutions as
  needed, enabling organizations to choose whatever solutions fit best for them,
  and to better adapt to evolving.
- Finally, the flexibility and scalability of security data pipelines are
  unmatched. They can scale up or down according to need. They also make it easy
  to support new data types and security scenarios, helping to future-proof your
  security architecture, and providing operational plasticity and resilience.

Security data pipelines are transforming the security operations landscape by
providing a more effective and efficient way to manage the ever-growing volumes
of security data. As the volume, variety, and velocity of security data continue
to increase, the need for more effective data management and analysis tools will
only grow as well.

At Tenzir, we are leading this transformation, building an open platform that
empowers security teams to build and deploy efficient security data pipelines
using plug-and-play building blocks. Our goal is simple—more time for threat
hunting, less time and money on data engineering, and a more robust
cybersecurity posture overall.

In today's complex cybersecurity landscape, data pipelines are not just for data
engineers anymore. They have become indispensable for security teams. The era
for security data pipelines isn't on the horizon, it's already here.
