As an incident responder, threat hunter, or detection engineer, getting quickly
to your analytics is key for productivity. For network-based visibility and
detection, [Zeek](https://zeek.org) and [Suricata](https://suricata.io) are the
bedrock for many security teams. But operationalizing these tools can take a
good chunk of time.

So we asked ourselves: **How can we make it super easy to work with Zeek and
Suricata logs?**

## Purring like a Suricat

In our [previous blog post](/archive/zeek-and-ye-shall-pipe/) we adapted Zeek to
behave like a good ol' Unix tool, taking input via stdin and producing output
via stdout. Turns out you can do the same fudgery with Suricata:[^1]

[^1]: Suricata outputs [EVE
JSON](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html)
by default, which is equivalent to Zeek's streaming JSON output, with the
difference being that Zeek's `_path` field is called `event_type` in Suricata
logs.

```bash title=suricatify
#!/bin/sh
suricata -r /dev/stdin \
  --set outputs.1.eve-log.filename=/dev/stdout \
  --set logging.outputs.0.console.enabled=no
```

Let's break this down:

- The `--set` option take a `name=value` parameter that overrides the settings
  in your `suricata.yaml` config file.
- The key `outputs.1.eve-log.filename` refers to the `outputs` array, takes
  element at index `1`, treats that as object and goes to the nested field
  `eve-log.filename`. Setting `/dev/stdout` as filename makes Suricata write to
  stdout.
- We must set `logging.outputs.0.console.enabled` to `no` because Suricata
  writes startup log messages to stdout. Since they are not valid JSON, we
  would otherwise create an invalid JSON output stream.

## User-defined Operators

Now that we have both Zeek and Suricata at our fingertips, how can we work with
their output more easily? This is where Tenzir comes into playâ€”easy pipelines
for security teams to acquire, shape, and route event data.

Here are two examples that count the number of unique source IP addresses per
destination IP address, on both Zeek and Suricata data:

```bash
# Zeek
zcat pcap.gz | zeekify | tenzir \
  'read zeek-json
   | where #schema == "zeek.conn"
   | summarize n=count_distinct(id.orig_h) by id.resp_h
   | sort n desc'
# Suricata
zcat pcap.gz | suricatify | tenzir \
  'read suricata
   | where #schema == "suricata.flow"
   | summarize n=count_distinct(src_ip) by dst_ip
   | sort n desc'
```

It's a bit unwieldy to write such a command line that requires an external shell
script to work. This is where user-defined operators come into play. In
combination with the `shell` operator, you can write a custom `zeek` and
`suricata` operator and ditch the shell script:

```yaml title="tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  operators:
    zeek:
     shell "zeek -r - LogAscii::output_to_stdout=T
            JSONStreaming::disable_default_logs=T
            JSONStreaming::enable_log_rotation=F
            json-streaming-logs"
     | read zeek-json
    suricata:
     shell "suricata -r /dev/stdin
            --set outputs.1.eve-log.filename=/dev/stdout
            --set logging.outputs.0.console.enabled=no"
     | read suricata
```

The difference stands out when you look now at the pipeline definition:

```text title=Zeek
zeek
| where #schema == "zeek.conn"
| summarize n=count_distinct(id.orig_h) by id.resp_h
| sort n desc
```

```text bash title=Suricata
suricata
| where #schema == "suricata.flow"
| summarize n=count_distinct(src_ip) by dst_ip
| sort n desc
```

It's pretty convenient to drop packets into a Tenzir pipeline, process them with
our favorite tools, and then perform fast in-situ analytics on them. The nice
thing is that operators compose: a new operator automatically works with all
existing ones.

## How does it work?

First, let's take a look at the standard approach where one process pipes the
output into the next:

![Piping Zeek to Tenzir](zeek-to-tenzir-pipe.excalidraw.svg)

When using the `shell` operator, the `tenzir` process spawns `zeek` or
`suricata` as child process. The operator then forwards the bytes from stdin of
the `tenzir` process to the child's stdin, and uses the child's stdout as input
to the subsequent `read` operator.

![Shelling out to Zeek](zeek-to-tenzir-shell.excalidraw.svg)

In the above example, `shell` acts as a *source* operator, i.e., it does not
consume input and only produces output. The `shell` operator can also act as
*transformation*, i.e., additionally accept input. This makes it possible to use
it more flexibly in combination with other operators, e.g., the `load` operator
emitting bytes from a loader:

```
load file trace.pcap
| zeek
| where 6.6.6.6
| write json
```

Got a PCAP trace via Kafka? Just exchange the `file` loader with the `kafka`
loader:

```
load kafka -t artifact
| zeek
| where 6.6.6.6
| write json
```

You may not always sit in front of a command line and are able to pipe data from
a Unix tool into a Tenzir pipeline. For example, when you use our
[app](https://app.tenzir.com) or the [REST API](/rest-api). This is where the
`shell` operator shines. The diagram above shows how `shell` shifts the entry
point of data from a tool to the Tenzir process. You can consider `shell` your
escape hatch to reach deeper into a specific Tenzir node, as if you had a native
shell.

## Conclusion

In this blog post we showed you the `shell` operator and how you can use it to
integrate third-party tooling into a Tenzir pipeline when coupled with
user-defined operators.
