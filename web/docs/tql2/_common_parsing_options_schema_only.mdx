### `raw = bool (optional)`

Use only the raw types that are native to the parsed format. Fields that have a type
specified in the chosen `schema` will still be parsed according to the schema.

Since grok is just textual parsing, this means that no parsing of data takes place at all
and every value remains a string, unless the field is in the `schema`.
