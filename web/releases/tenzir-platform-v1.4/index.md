## Platform Alerts

We've introduced a critical monitoring feature to ensure the reliability of your
infrastructure. The platform automatically alerts you when nodes are offline for
longer than a configured threshold.

These alerts provide essential visibility into the health of your nodes and
pipelines, enabling proactive management of system availability and rapid
response to potential outages.

For complete implementation details and configuration examples, refer to our
[Platform CLI](/platform-cli) documentation.

## Other Improvements

We've been busy sprinkling some improvements throughout the platform:

- Your workspace switching experience is now lightning-fast ⚡
- We've added a sleek new diagnostics drawer to the dashboard, making it just as
  easy to spot warnings or errors on the dashboard as in the explorer
- Chart images now download correctly even on the dashboard page
