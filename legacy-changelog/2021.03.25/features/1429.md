VAST now supports nested records in Arrow table slices and in the JSON import,
e.g., data of type `list<record<name: string, age: count>`. While nested record
fields are not yet queryable, ingesting such data will no longer cause VAST to
crash. MessagePack table slices don't support records in lists yet.
